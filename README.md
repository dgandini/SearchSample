# SearchSample
Sample project created to demonstrate the using of PredicateBuilder and PagedList as helpers to facilitate the dynamics queries creation.

# Comments
This is a quite simple implementation with the purpose to give an overview about a creation of simple search engine using dynamic queries.

Despite to be an decent implementation, there are some points to be improved:
* The order by can mess up the pagination (maybe the user could choose the ordering)
* Filters could support multiple values
* Selected filters could persist their values in order to improve the pagination
